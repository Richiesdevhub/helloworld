Richie here, excited to be on github already!!
My current job has allowed me to know and develop industrial automation: PLC, HMI, frecuency converters, servomotors, robots and industrial vision sensors, its a very exciting field.
Im currently learning HMTL and CSS, after that iÂ´ll go with javascript that is the logical thing to do, but really looking for be a full stack web developer and prominence in node.js.
The reason for me to try this new development path its because we are entering if not going in the middle of and industrial transformation, where the cyber systems use their capabilities to empower even further the automation in industry.
Because of the last statements i have interest in web development for distribute and acquire data, and python or R for data analysis.
The way of contact me is trought my email: risolfa@gmail.com
